# Gateway API Inference Extension Integration

> **Pinned versions:** the `GAIE_VERSION` referenced in this document is sourced from [`/versions.env`](https://github.com/ai-runway/airunway/blob/main/versions.env) at the repo root. Substitute that value (currently `v1.5.0`) when running the commands below, or `source` the file in your shell: `set -a; source versions.env; set +a`.

### Stable access for automatically configured models

Connect agents and external clients to the gateway endpoint and the model name
published in `ModelDeployment.status.gateway`. Do not bind them to a generated
Dynamo frontend Service name containing the profiling request hash. Runway
updates the model route when a replacement workload becomes ready, so a backend
name change does not require changing the client's base URL. Replacement may
still interrupt service; a stable endpoint is not a zero-downtime guarantee.

## Overview

AI Runway integrates with the [Gateway API Inference Extension](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension) to provide a unified inference gateway. Instead of accessing each model's Service individually, you deploy a single Gateway and call **all** models through one endpoint using the standard OpenAI-compatible API. The Gateway routes requests to the correct model based on the `model` field in the request body.

When gateway integration is active, AI Runway automatically creates an **InferencePool**, **Endpoint Picker (EPP)**, and an **HTTPRoute** for each `ModelDeployment`. You only need to provide the Gateway itself.

**Request flow:** Client → Gateway (+BBR) → HTTPRoute → InferencePool → Endpoint Picker (EPP) → Model Server Pod

**What AI Runway creates automatically** (when `gateway.enabled` is `true` or omitted, and Gateway CRDs are detected):

- `InferencePool` — selects pods labeled with `airunway.ai/model-deployment: <name>` on the model's serving port
- `HTTPRoute` — routes from the Gateway to the InferencePool (unless `httpRouteRef` is set)
- `EPP` — Endpoint Picker Proxy for intelligent endpoint selection

**What you provide:**

- A Gateway resource (with any compatible implementation)

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with [Gateway API CRDs](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#installing-gateway-api) installed
- [Gateway API Inference Extension CRDs](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension) installed (provides `InferencePool`)
- A compatible gateway implementation (see below)

## Gateway Implementations

AI Runway works with any Gateway API implementation that supports the [Inference Extension](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension). You are responsible for installing and managing your own gateway. Some known implementations:

| Implementation | `gatewayClassName` | Status | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Envoy Gateway](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/) | `eg` | Not tested | [Inference Extension guide](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/docs/tasks/ai-gateway/gateway-api-inference-extension/) |
| [Istio](https://istio.io/) | `istio` | Tested | [Inference Extension guide](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/inference/) |
| [kgateway](https://kgateway.dev/) | `kgateway` | Tested (still requires the `X-Gateway-Model-Name` header) | [Inference Extension guide](https://kgateway.dev/docs/ai/gateway-api-inference-extension/) |
| [GKE Gateway](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/gateway-api) | `gke-l7-rilb` | Not tested | [GKE Inference guide](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/serve-llms-with-gateway-api) |

> **Note:** The only difference between implementations is the `gatewayClassName` in your Gateway resource. All AIRunway-managed resources (InferencePool, HTTPRoute) are identical regardless of which gateway you use.

## Setup

> [!TIP]
> **Istio shortcut:** `make setup-gateway` (from the repo root) performs the entire manual
> **Istio** setup below in one shot — it installs the Gateway API CRDs (Step 1), the Gateway
> API Inference Extension (GAIE) CRDs (Step 2), Istio with the inference extension enabled
> (Step 3), the `inference-gateway` Gateway resource (Step 4), and the Body-Based Router (see
> [Body-Based Routing](#body-based-routing-bbr)). The
> `GATEWAY_API_VERSION`, `ISTIO_VERSION`, and `GAIE_VERSION` it uses are pinned in
> [`/versions.env`](https://github.com/ai-runway/airunway/blob/main/versions.env), and `istioctl` must be on your PATH. For other gateway
> implementations, follow the manual steps below.

### Step 1: Install Gateway API CRDs

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/latest/download/standard-install.yaml
```

### Step 2: Install Gateway API Inference Extension CRDs

```bash
kubectl apply -f "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension/releases/download/${GAIE_VERSION}/manifests.yaml"
```

### Step 3: Install a Gateway Implementation

Follow the installation guide for your chosen implementation:

- **Envoy Gateway:** [quickstart](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/docs/tasks/quickstart/)
- **Istio:** [getting started](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/)
- **kgateway:** [quickstart](https://kgateway.dev/docs/quickstart/)

> [!NOTE]
> **Istio:** Inference Extension support must be explicitly enabled by setting `ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_INFERENCE_EXTENSION=true` on the `istiod` deployment (or passing `--set values.pilot.env.ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_INFERENCE_EXTENSION=true` during `istioctl install`). Without this, Istio ignores InferencePool backend refs in HTTPRoutes. The `minimal` profile is sufficient — Istio auto-creates a gateway deployment and LoadBalancer Service when you create a Gateway resource. See the [Istio Inference Extension guide](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api-inference-extension/) for full details.

### Step 4: Create a Gateway Resource

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: inference-gateway
  namespace: default
spec:
  gatewayClassName: eg  # Change to match your implementation
  infrastructure:
    annotations:
      # Required on AKS with Istio. Azure otherwise probes GET / on port 80,
      # but the gateway returns 404 there and the public IP can time out.
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/port_80_health-probe_protocol: tcp
  listeners:
    - name: http
      protocol: HTTP
      port: 80
```

If you have multiple Gateways in the cluster, label the one to use for inference:

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    airunway.ai/inference-gateway: "true"
```

> [!NOTE]
> **AKS with Istio:** Keep the `spec.infrastructure.annotations.service.beta.kubernetes.io/port_80_health-probe_protocol: tcp`
> setting in your Gateway. Azure otherwise configures an HTTP health probe for `/` on port `80`, but Istio's generated
> gateway returns `404` on `/`. The result is a public IP that times out even though the gateway works through
> `kubectl port-forward` or from inside the cluster.

### Step 5: Deploy Models

Deploy models as usual. AI Runway automatically creates the InferencePool, EPP, and HTTPRoute:

```yaml
apiVersion: airunway.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelDeployment
metadata:
  name: qwen3
  namespace: default
spec:
  model:
    id: "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"
  gateway:
    enabled: true  # Optional: enabled by default when Gateway is detected; set to false to explicitly disable
```

The `ModelDeployment` status will show gateway information once ready:

```bash
kubectl get modeldeployment qwen3 -o jsonpath='{.status.gateway}'
```

The gateway status now includes the selected Gateway identity (`gatewayName`, `gatewayNamespace`) in addition to `endpoint` and `modelName`.

## Configuration

### Auto-detection

The controller auto-detects Gateway API Inference Extension CRDs at startup by querying the Kubernetes discovery API. If the CRDs (`InferencePool`, `HTTPRoute`, `Gateway`) are present, gateway integration is enabled. If not, it is silently disabled — no errors, no resources created.

### Explicit Gateway Selection

If you have multiple Gateways or want deterministic behavior, use controller flags:

```
--gateway-name=inference-gateway
--gateway-namespace=default
```

When set, the controller always uses the specified Gateway as the HTTPRoute parent instead of auto-detecting.

### Endpoint Picker (EPP) Configuration

The controller automatically deploys an EPP (Endpoint Picker Proxy) per ModelDeployment, named `<deployment-name>-epp`. The EPP handles intelligent request routing to model server pods.

```
--epp-service-port=9002               # EPP Service port (default: 9002)
--epp-image=<image>                   # EPP container image (default: upstream GAIE image)
--patch-gateway-allowed-routes=true   # Patch Gateway allowedRoutes for cross-namespace routing (default: true)
```

### Body-Based Routing (BBR)

When serving **multiple models** through a single Gateway, a Body-Based Router (BBR) is needed to extract the `model` field from the request body and route to the correct InferencePool. BBR is a separate component deployed via the upstream GAIE helm chart.

Install BBR using the upstream helm chart:

```bash
helm install body-based-router \
  --set provider.name=istio \
  --version "${GAIE_VERSION}" \
  oci://registry.k8s.io/gateway-api-inference-extension/charts/body-based-routing
```

> [!NOTE]
> The BBR chart version should match the GAIE version used by AI Runway. The pinned value lives in [`/versions.env`](https://github.com/ai-runway/airunway/blob/main/versions.env); update both at the same time when bumping.

Replace `provider.name` with your gateway implementation (`istio`, `gke`, or omit for others). The chart deploys the BBR container and any provider-specific resources (e.g. EnvoyFilter for Istio).

See the [upstream multi-model guide](https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/guides/serving-multiple-inference-pools-latest/) for full details.

> [!NOTE]
> **Adding a model needs no BBR restart.** BBR holds no model registry. On every
> request its `body-field-to-header` plugin reads the `model` field from the body
> and copies it into `X-Gateway-Model-Name`; when that field is missing or empty
> it records a metric, skips the header, and lets the request through without it.
> Either way the decision is made from the request body alone — BBR never looks
> up HTTPRoutes or InferencePools, and its ServiceAccount is only granted
> `get`/`list`/`watch` on ConfigMaps, so it cannot read them. The one piece of
> state it does cache is the optional LoRA adapter → base-model map, kept current
> by a live watch on ConfigMaps labelled
> `inference.networking.k8s.io/bbr-managed`. A new `ModelDeployment` therefore
> starts routing as soon as the Gateway admits the HTTPRoute for its model name.
>
> Earlier releases rolled the shared BBR Deployment once per new
> `ModelDeployment` on the mistaken premise that it built a registry at startup.
> That restart was never load-bearing and opened a window in which a request for
> an already-serving model could mis-route to another model's InferencePool
> ([#334](https://github.com/ai-runway/airunway/issues/334)); it has been
> removed. ModelDeployments created by an older controller may still carry an
> inert `airunway.ai/bbr-restarted` annotation, which nothing reads and which is
> safe to leave in place.

### Auto-detection with Multiple Gateways

When no explicit gateway is configured and multiple Gateway resources exist in the cluster, the controller looks for one labeled with:

```yaml
airunway.ai/inference-gateway: "true"
```

If no labeled Gateway is found, the controller skips gateway reconciliation and sets the `GatewayReady` condition to `False`.

### Cross-namespace Gateway

When the Gateway is in a different namespace than the ModelDeployment, the controller automatically patches each Gateway listener to allow HTTPRoutes from the ModelDeployment's namespace using a namespace selector. The selector is a `matchExpressions` In-list so that multiple cross-namespace ModelDeployments can share one Gateway, and it always includes the **Gateway's own namespace** so that routes living alongside the Gateway are never evicted:

```yaml
allowedRoutes:
  namespaces:
    from: Selector
    selector:
      matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name
          operator: In
          values:
            - <gateway-namespace>          # always retained
            - <modeldeployment-namespace>  # one entry per cross-namespace deployment
```

This is required because Gateway API uses `allowedRoutes` on the listener to control cross-namespace route binding. Without it, the Gateway will reject HTTPRoutes from other namespaces.

When the last cross-namespace ModelDeployment using the Gateway is removed, the controller reverts each listener back to `from: Same` (dropping the selector), which again implicitly allows routes from the Gateway's own namespace.

> [!NOTE]
> Earlier controller versions wrote a single-namespace `matchLabels` selector and, when converting a listener from the default `from: Same`, could drop the Gateway's own namespace — evicting every HTTPRoute co-located with the Gateway. The controller now always retains the Gateway's namespace in the selector. A Gateway left in the old broken state is repaired the next time a new namespace is added or the last cross-namespace deployment is removed.

**Opting out of Gateway patching:** In security-conscious environments where a Gateway admin manages `allowedRoutes` independently, start the controller with `--patch-gateway-allowed-routes=false`. The controller will skip patching the Gateway globally, and the admin is responsible for configuring the listener to accept HTTPRoutes from ModelDeployment namespaces.

> [!NOTE]
> When `--patch-gateway-allowed-routes=false` is set and the Gateway does not allow routes from the ModelDeployment's namespace, the HTTPRoute will not be accepted by the Gateway and the model will not be reachable through the gateway endpoint.

### Per-deployment Configuration

Each `ModelDeployment` can override gateway behavior:

```yaml
spec:
  gateway:
    # Disable gateway integration for this specific deployment
    enabled: false
    # Override the model name used in routing (defaults to auto-discovered from /v1/models, or spec.model.id)
    modelName: "my-custom-model-name"
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `spec.gateway.enabled` | `true` (when Gateway detected) | Set to `false` to skip InferencePool/HTTPRoute creation |
| `spec.gateway.modelName` | Auto-discovered or `spec.model.id` | Model name used for routing and in API requests |

## Provider-Managed Gateway Resources

Some inference providers (e.g., NVIDIA Dynamo, llm-d) have native Gateway API Inference Extension support with their own InferencePool and Endpoint Picker (EPP). These providers deploy specialized EPPs with capabilities beyond the generic upstream EPP — for example, Dynamo's EPP uses **KV-cache-aware scoring** to route requests to endpoints with the highest KV cache hit probability.

When a provider declares gateway capabilities in its `InferenceProviderConfig`, the controller adapts what it creates. Two extension points exist:

1. **Full delegation** (`managesInferencePool: true`): the provider owns both the InferencePool and the EPP. The controller skips creating either and only wires the HTTPRoute. Used by Dynamo.
2. **EPP customization** (`endpointPicker: { image, configData }`): the controller still creates the InferencePool, EPP & scaffolding, but substitutes the provider's EPP image and plugin configuration. Used by llm-d.

`endpointPicker` is ignored when `managesInferencePool: true` — full delegation supersedes any EPP override.

### How It Works

Providers declare gateway capabilities in their `InferenceProviderConfig`:

```yaml
apiVersion: airunway.ai/v1alpha1
kind: InferenceProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: dynamo
spec:
  capabilities:
    engines:
      - name: vllm
        gateway:
          managesInferencePool: true                # Provider creates and owns the InferencePool/EPP
          inferencePoolNamePattern: "{name}-pool"   # Pattern for the pool name
          inferencePoolNamespace: "{namespace}"     # Namespace where the pool is created
      - name: sglang
        gateway:
          managesInferencePool: true
          inferencePoolNamePattern: "{name}-pool"
          inferencePoolNamespace: "{namespace}"
      - name: trtllm
        gateway:
          managesInferencePool: true
          inferencePoolNamePattern: "{name}-pool"
          inferencePoolNamespace: "{namespace}"
```

The controller adapts its reconciliation based on these fields:

| Field | When set | When unset / absent |
|---|---|---|
| `managesInferencePool` | When set to `true`, controller waits for the provider's InferencePool to exist, then uses it as the HTTPRoute backend. Skips `reconcileInferencePool()`, `reconcileEPP()`, and `labelModelPods()`. | Controller creates and owns the InferencePool and the EPP (default behavior). |
| `endpointPicker.image` / `endpointPicker.configData` | Controller still creates the InferencePool and EPP Deployment/Service, but the EPP container uses the provider's image and the EPP ConfigMap carries `configData` as `default-plugins.yaml`. | Controller deploys the generic upstream GAIE EPP image with an empty plugin config. |

The HTTPRoute is **always** managed by the controller regardless of provider capabilities.

### Cross-Namespace Routing

Provider-managed resources often live in a different namespace than the ModelDeployment (e.g., Dynamo pods and InferencePool are in `dynamo-system`). The controller handles this by:

1. Setting the HTTPRoute backend ref with the provider pool's namespace
2. Creating a `ReferenceGrant` in the pool's namespace to allow cross-namespace HTTPRoute references

```
Single Gateway
  ├─ HTTPRoute "llama-70b" → Dynamo InferencePool (dynamo-system) → KV-aware EPP
  ├─ HTTPRoute "phi-4"     → Controller InferencePool (default)   → generic EPP → KAITO
  └─ HTTPRoute "mistral"   → Controller InferencePool (default)   → generic EPP → KubeRay
```

### Pool Name Resolution

The `inferencePoolNamePattern` supports `{name}` and `{namespace}` placeholders, substituted with the ModelDeployment's name and namespace:

| Pattern | ModelDeployment `default/llama-70b` | Resolved Pool Name |
|---|---|---|
| `{namespace}-{name}-pool` | `default/llama-70b` | `default-llama-70b-pool` |
| `{name}-pool` | `default/llama-70b` | `llama-70b-pool` |
| _(empty)_ | `default/llama-70b` | `llama-70b` (fallback to MD name) |

### Cleanup Behavior

When gateway resources are cleaned up (e.g., `gateway.enabled: false`):

- **Controller-managed** InferencePool and EPP resources are deleted normally
- **Provider-managed** InferencePool and EPP resources are **not deleted** — they are owned by the provider and cleaned up when the underlying provider CRD (e.g., DynamoGraphDeployment) is deleted
- The **HTTPRoute** is always deleted by the controller (it always owns the HTTPRoute)

### Dynamo Provider Gateway Support

The Dynamo provider registers full gateway capabilities. When a manually configured ModelDeployment uses Dynamo with gateway enabled:

1. The Runway provider creates a `DynamoGraphDeployment` with an `Epp` component configured for KV-cache-aware scoring
2. The Dynamo operator creates an InferencePool pointing at its managed EPP
3. The AIRunway controller detects the provider's gateway capabilities, waits for the InferencePool, creates the ReferenceGrant and HTTPRoute
4. Requests are routed through Dynamo's intelligent EPP instead of the generic EPP since that EPP creation has been skipped.

#### Istio workaround for Dynamo native EPP

This config-only workaround was validated with **Dynamo 1.5.0, Istio 1.30.0 and
GAIE 1.5.0**, using an aggregated vLLM deployment on one A100. Streaming and
non-streaming chat requests passed, including after an EPP restart. Other
versions, engines and topologies require their own validation.

It applies to the native Rust EPP path through an **InferencePool**. A
DGDR-generated topology routed directly to a standalone Frontend Service does
not use this EPP hop and does not need the workaround.

Two settings are required, even when the client uses non-streaming chat:

1. Set the EPP gRPC service's **authority** to its Service DNS name. Without it,
   Envoy defaults to the internal cluster name, such as `outbound|9002||...`.
   With `autoSni` enabled, that value becomes invalid TLS SNI and Rustls rejects
   the handshake. Changing only the fixed TLS SNI does not override `autoSni`.
2. Set `send_body_without_waiting_for_header_response: true` on the gateway's
   EPP HTTP filter. Rust EPP needs the request body to tokenize the prompt and
   select a worker before answering the header callback. The existing
   `FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED` request and response modes must remain enabled.

> [!WARNING]
> The authority patch is per route. The body-streaming setting applies to
> **all EPP routes on the selected Gateway's HTTP listener**, not just this model.
> It matches `envoy.filters.http.ext_proc` exactly and does not modify the separate
> `envoy.filters.http.ext_proc.bbr` body-based-router filter. Validate other EPP
> implementations sharing that gateway before enabling it. EnvoyFilter depends
> on Istio/Envoy internals, so repeat the checks below after upgrades.

**Locate the active route first.** Use the intended cluster context and a ready
pod belonging to the selected Gateway. If the gateway has several replicas,
repeat the verification on each replica.

```bash
CONTEXT="your-cluster-context"
GATEWAY_NAMESPACE="default"
GATEWAY_NAME="inference-gateway"

kubectl --context "$CONTEXT" -n "$GATEWAY_NAMESPACE" get pods \
  -l "gateway.networking.k8s.io/gateway-name=$GATEWAY_NAME" -o wide

GATEWAY_POD="replace-with-a-ready-gateway-pod"
istioctl --context "$CONTEXT" proxy-config routes "$GATEWAY_POD" \
  -n "$GATEWAY_NAMESPACE" -o json |
  jq '[.[] | .virtualHosts[]?.routes[]?
    | select(.typedPerFilterConfig["envoy.filters.http.ext_proc"].overrides.grpcService.envoyGrpc.clusterName != null)
    | {route: .name,
       grpc: .typedPerFilterConfig["envoy.filters.http.ext_proc"].overrides.grpcService.envoyGrpc,
       processingMode: .typedPerFilterConfig["envoy.filters.http.ext_proc"].overrides.processingMode,
       failureModeAllow: .typedPerFilterConfig["envoy.filters.http.ext_proc"].overrides.failureModeAllow}]'
```

The example below assumes Gateway `default/inference-gateway` on port `80`,
Envoy route `default.qwen3.0`, and EPP Service `default/qwen3-epp` on port
`9002`. Replace the namespace, gateway selector, listener port, route name,
cluster name and Service DNS authority with the values for your deployment.
Set `metadata.namespace` to the Gateway namespace; use the EPP Service's
namespace in `clusterName` and `authority`. These namespaces may differ.
Copy the **actual Envoy route and cluster names** from the active configuration;
do not assume their naming convention is stable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Preserve the **complete existing** `typedPerFilterConfig["envoy.filters.http.ext_proc"]`
> entry. Istio's `MERGE` replaces this map entry rather than recursively merging
> its contents. A patch containing only `authority` drops the required
> `clusterName` and causes Envoy to reject the route update. The example includes
> the complete validated default entry; retain any additional fields in your
> installation instead of overwriting them with these defaults. Treat full proxy

            send_body_without_waiting_for_header_response: true
```

Review existing EnvoyFilters for conflicts before applying this one. If both
settings are already active, do not add a duplicate workaround. Runway does not
create or manage this workaround automatically.

```bash
kubectl --context "$CONTEXT" -n "$GATEWAY_NAMESPACE" get envoyfilters
kubectl --context "$CONTEXT" apply --dry-run=server -f native-epp-compat.yaml
kubectl --context "$CONTEXT" apply -f native-epp-compat.yaml
```

**Verify the effective configuration and traffic.** A successful apply, Ready
pods or an accepted HTTPRoute alone do not prove this path works.

- Repeat the route inspection above. Confirm the DNS authority is present,
  `clusterName` is unchanged, both body modes are `FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED`, and
  `failureModeAllow` is still `false`. If the gateway reports
  `EnvoyGrpcValidationError.ClusterName`, reconstruct the complete map entry;
  Envoy retained the previous route after rejecting the incomplete update.
- Inspect the listener below. Only the EPP filter should gain
  `sendBodyWithoutWaitingForHeaderResponse: true`; BBR's configuration must
  remain unchanged. A Rust EPP `ProtocolConfiguration mismatch` reporting this
  flag as false means the listener change is not active.
- Confirm the EPP cluster's TLS settings, HTTP/2 and `h2` ALPN are unchanged,
  and the InferencePool still uses `FailClose`.
- [Call the model through the gateway](#calling-models-via-curl) with both
  `stream: false` and `stream: true`. Require a real completion and the SSE
  `[DONE]` marker, not just HTTP 200. In a test deployment, restart the EPP
  and repeat to check reconnection behavior.

```bash
istioctl --context "$CONTEXT" proxy-config listeners "$GATEWAY_POD" \
  -n "$GATEWAY_NAMESPACE" --port 80 -o json |
  jq '[.[] | .filterChains[]?.filters[]?
    | select(.name == "envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager")
    | .typedConfig.httpFilters[]
    | select(.name == "envoy.filters.http.ext_proc" or .name == "envoy.filters.http.ext_proc.bbr")
    | {name, sendBodyWithoutWaitingForHeaderResponse: .typedConfig.sendBodyWithoutWaitingForHeaderResponse}]'
```

Use your actual listener port in that command. This workaround leaves the
existing certificate trust configuration unchanged. Dynamo 1.5's native EPP
uses an ephemeral self-signed certificate; a valid DNS authority does not add
CA or Service-DNS identity verification.

**Maintain or remove it explicitly.** Update the route patch if the route or EPP
Service identity changes. Deleting the ModelDeployment does not delete this
manually installed EnvoyFilter. Before removing it, check whether other Rust EPP
routes depend on its shared listener setting; preserve that setting if needed.
For the example, removal is:

```bash
kubectl --context "$CONTEXT" -n "$GATEWAY_NAMESPACE" \
  delete envoyfilter qwen3-native-epp-compat
```

### llm-d Provider Gateway Support

The llm-d provider takes the EPP-customization path: the controller still owns the InferencePool and the EPP Deployment/Service, but uses llm-d's scheduler image and plugin chain. The provider declares only `endpointPicker` on the vLLM engine — `managesInferencePool` stays `false`:

```yaml
apiVersion: airunway.ai/v1alpha1
kind: InferenceProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: llmd
spec:
  capabilities:
    engines:
      - name: vllm
        gateway:
          endpointPicker:
            image: ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-inference-scheduler:v0.6.0
            configData: |
              apiVersion: inference.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
              kind: EndpointPickerConfig
              plugins:
              - type: prefix-cache-scorer
              - type: decode-filter
              - type: max-score-picker
              - type: single-profile-handler
              schedulingProfiles:
              - name: default
                plugins:
                - pluginRef: decode-filter
                - pluginRef: max-score-picker
                - pluginRef: prefix-cache-scorer
                  weight: 2
```

When a ModelDeployment uses llm-d with gateway enabled:

1. The llm-d provider creates the model server Deployment + Service in the ModelDeployment's namespace
2. The AIRunway controller creates the InferencePool, the EPP Deployment + Service (using the llm-d image), the EPP ConfigMap (containing `configData` as `default-plugins.yaml`), and the HTTPRoute
3. Requests are routed through the llm-d scheduler's plugin chain (prefix-cache-aware scoring, decode-filter, max-score-picker) instead of the generic EPP defaults

### Model Name Resolution

The controller resolves the gateway model name using this priority:

1. **`spec.gateway.modelName`** — explicit override, always wins
2. **`spec.model.servedName`** — user-specified served name
3. **Auto-discovered from `/v1/models`** — the controller probes the running model server's OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` endpoint and uses the first model ID returned. This handles baked-in images where the served name differs from `spec.model.id`.
4. **`spec.model.id`** — final fallback

Auto-discovery runs only when the deployment reaches `Running` phase. If the probe fails (timeout, error, no models), it silently falls through to the next level.

### AgentDeployment `deploymentRef` integration

Agent deployments that bind with `spec.model.deploymentRef` reuse this gateway resolution path. When a target `ModelDeployment` records a Gateway identity in status, the agent binding reads that Gateway and combines a usable published address with its sole HTTPRoute-capable, ready HTTP(S) listener. This also handles the case where the Gateway publishes its first address later. The controller periodically rechecks Gateway-backed bindings because it does not watch Gateway status directly. If multiple compatible ready listeners exist, `deploymentRef` keeps the endpoint already published by the `ModelDeployment` because it has no listener selector. It rejects the binding when none of those listeners are ready. If no Gateway identity is recorded, resolution falls back to the model Service endpoint.

For direct `spec.model.gatewayEndpoint` bindings, `gatewayRef.listenerName`
selects a specific listener. It may be omitted only when exactly one compatible
listener exists. The listener must allow HTTPRoute attachments and report current
`Accepted`, `ResolvedRefs`, and `Programmed` conditions as true. A concrete
listener hostname becomes the URL authority for HTTP Host matching and HTTPS
SNI/certificate validation. A listener without a hostname uses the published
Gateway IP or hostname; wildcard listener hostnames are rejected.

`status.gateway.gatewayName` and `gatewayNamespace` record which Gateway was selected, for diagnostics. They are deliberately not used to build an in-cluster Service URL: Gateway API does not require the data-plane Service to be named after the Gateway resource, so `<gatewayName>.<gatewayNamespace>.svc.cluster.local` is not portable across implementations.

## Using the Gateway

### Finding the Gateway Endpoint

```bash
# Get the Gateway address
kubectl get gateway inference-gateway -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}'

# Or check the ModelDeployment status
kubectl get modeldeployment qwen3 -o jsonpath='{.status.gateway.endpoint}'
```

### Calling Models via curl

```bash
GATEWAY_IP=$(kubectl get gateway inference-gateway -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')

curl http://${GATEWAY_IP}/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

### Calling Models via Python (OpenAI SDK)

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url=f"http://{GATEWAY_IP}/v1",
    api_key="unused",  # No auth by default
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Multiple Models, One Endpoint

The gateway routes to the correct model based on the `model` field in the request body. Deploy multiple models and call them all through the same endpoint:

```bash
# Call model A
curl http://${GATEWAY_IP}/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}]}'

# Call model B through the same endpoint
curl http://${GATEWAY_IP}/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}]}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway integration is not activating

**Symptom:** No InferencePool or HTTPRoute created for deployments.

1. Check that CRDs are installed:

   ```bash
   kubectl api-resources | grep -E "inferencepools|httproutes|gateways"
   ```

2. Check controller logs for detection messages:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n airunway-system deploy/airunway-controller-manager | grep -i gateway
   ```

3. If CRDs were installed after the controller started, restart the controller to refresh detection.

### GatewayReady condition is False

**Symptom:** `ModelDeployment` has `GatewayReady=False`.

1. Check the condition message:

   ```bash
   kubectl get modeldeployment <name> -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}' | jq '.[] | select(.type=="GatewayReady")'
   ```

2. Common reasons:
   - **NoGateway** — No Gateway resource found. Create one or set `--gateway-name`/`--gateway-namespace`.
   - **Multiple Gateways** — Multiple Gateways exist but none is labeled `airunway.ai/inference-gateway=true`.
   - **InferencePoolFailed** / **HTTPRouteFailed** — RBAC issue or CRD version mismatch.

### Native Dynamo EPP returns HTTP 500 despite Ready pods

For Rust EPP on Istio, check for `Illegal SNI hostname` or
`ProtocolConfiguration mismatch` in EPP logs. See the
[version-scoped Istio workaround](#istio-workaround-for-dynamo-native-epp) for
the required authority and body-streaming settings.

### Requests return 404 or connection refused

1. Verify the Gateway has an address:

   ```bash
   kubectl get gateway inference-gateway -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses}'
   ```

2. Verify the HTTPRoute is accepted:

   ```bash
   kubectl get httproute <deployment-name> -o yaml
   ```

3. Verify the InferencePool matches running pods:

   ```bash
   kubectl get inferencepool <deployment-name> -o yaml
   kubectl get pods -l airunway.ai/model-deployment=<deployment-name>
   ```

4. If the Gateway has a public IP on AKS but requests to that IP time out, make sure the Gateway sets:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     infrastructure:
       annotations:
         service.beta.kubernetes.io/port_80_health-probe_protocol: tcp
   ```

   Azure can otherwise probe `GET /` on port `80`. Istio's gateway returns `404` there, so the load balancer marks the
   backend unhealthy even though requests succeed through `kubectl port-forward`.
