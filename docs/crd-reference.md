# CRD Reference

## ModelDeployment

Unified API for deploying ML models.

```yaml
apiVersion: airunway.ai/v1alpha1
kind: ModelDeployment
metadata:
  name: my-model
  namespace: default
spec:
  model:
    id: "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"       # HuggingFace model ID
    source: huggingface          # huggingface or custom
    storage:
      volumes:
        - name: model-cache      # DNS label, unique per deployment
          purpose: modelCache    # modelCache, compilationCache, or custom
          # Option A: reference a pre-existing PVC
          claimName: pvc-claim
          # readOnly: false         # optional, default false
          # Option B: let the controller create a PVC (omit claimName, set size)
          # size: 100Gi
          # storageClassName: azurelustre-static   # omit to use cluster default
          # accessMode: ReadWriteMany              # default when size is set
          mountPath: /model-cache  # required when purpose is custom; defaults for cache purposes
  engine:
    type: vllm                   # vllm, sglang, trtllm, llamacpp (optional, auto-selected)
    image: ""                    # Engine-specific image override; preferred for Direct vLLM/custom vLLM images
    contextLength: 32768
    trustRemoteCode: false
    enablePrefixCaching: true
    enforceEager: false
    args: {}                     # Engine-specific named flags, passed through by providers
    extraArgs: []                # Additional raw engine flags
  provider:
    name: ""                     # Optional: explicit provider selection
  serving:
    mode: aggregated             # aggregated or disaggregated
  resources:
    gpu:
      count: 1
      type: "nvidia.com/gpu"
  scaling:
    replicas: 1
  image: ""                      # Legacy provider-level image override; prefer spec.engine.image for Direct vLLM
  gateway:
    enabled: true                # Optional: defaults to true when Gateway detected
    modelName: ""                # Optional: override model name for routing
```

> **Note:** If `gateway.enabled` is explicitly set to `true` but the Gateway API Inference Extension CRDs are not installed, the controller sets a `GatewayReady=False` condition with reason `CRDsNotAvailable`. This surfaces as a status warning on the `ModelDeployment`.

### spec.engine

`spec.engine` defines the model-server runtime and engine-level launch settings.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | string | no | Engine type: `vllm`, `sglang`, `trtllm`, or `llamacpp`. If omitted, the controller auto-selects from provider capabilities. |
| `image` | string | no | Engine-specific container image override. This is the preferred field for Direct vLLM and custom vLLM OpenAI-compatible server images. |
| `contextLength` | int | no | Maximum context length. Providers map this to engine-specific flags such as vLLM `--max-model-len`. |
| `trustRemoteCode` | bool | no | Allows remote HuggingFace model code execution when supported by the engine. |
| `enablePrefixCaching` | bool | no | Enables prefix caching when supported by the engine. |
| `enforceEager` | bool | no | Forces eager execution when supported by the engine. |
| `args` | map[string]string | no | Engine-specific named arguments. Providers pass these through to the engine; for boolean-style flags, use an empty string value when supported by the provider. |
| `extraArgs` | []string | no | Additional raw engine flags for arguments that do not have a structured field or map representation yet. |

### spec.image (legacy)

Top-level `spec.image` remains supported for backward compatibility as a provider-level custom image override. For Direct vLLM and custom vLLM launch images, prefer `spec.engine.image`.

### Direct vLLM image example

Use explicit provider/runtime selection and put the vLLM server image under `spec.engine.image`:

```yaml
spec:
  provider:
    name: vllm
  engine:
    type: vllm
    image: vllm/vllm-openai:cu130-nightly
    args:
      trust-remote-code: ""
```

### spec.model.storage.volumes[]

Each entry is a `StorageVolume`. Maximum 8 volumes per deployment.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | yes | Unique volume identifier. DNS label format (`[a-z0-9-]`, max 63 chars). |
| `purpose` | string | no | `modelCache`, `compilationCache`, or `custom` (default). Controls mount path defaults and engine behavior. Only one volume of each cache purpose is allowed. |
| `claimName` | string | conditional | Name of a pre-existing PVC in the same namespace. Required when `size` is not set. When `size` is set and `claimName` is empty, defaults to `<deployment-name>-<volume-name>`. |
| `mountPath` | string | conditional | Absolute path inside the container. Required when `purpose` is `custom`. Defaults: `/model-cache` for `modelCache`, `/compilation-cache` for `compilationCache`. |
| `readOnly` | bool | no | Mount the volume read-only. Default: `false`. |
| `size` | string | no | Requested storage size (e.g. `100Gi`). When set, the controller creates a PVC automatically. When omitted, `claimName` must reference a pre-existing PVC. |
| `storageClassName` | string | no | StorageClass for controller-created PVCs. Omit to use the cluster default. Set to `""` to disable dynamic provisioning. Only used when `size` is set. |
| `accessMode` | string | no | PVC access mode for controller-created PVCs. One of `ReadWriteOnce`, `ReadWriteMany`, `ReadOnlyMany`, `ReadWriteOncePod`. Default: `ReadWriteMany`. Only used when `size` is set. |

### spec.provider.overrides.intent.overrides

For Dynamo Automatic configuration, set `spec.provider.name: dynamo` and
`spec.provider.overrides.deploymentMode: intent`. The typed intent lives at
`spec.provider.overrides.intent`; its optional native customization object is
`spec.provider.overrides.intent.overrides`.

| Field within `intent.overrides` | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `profilingJob` | object | no | Native profiling-job options, such as `activeDeadlineSeconds: 1800`. |
| `dgd` | object | no | Partial generated DynamoGraphDeployment override. |
| `dgd.apiVersion` | string | with `dgd` | `nvidia.com/v1alpha1` for the legacy contract or `nvidia.com/v1beta1` for the Dynamo 1.5 contract. Beta overrides are not supported on 1.1.1. |
| `dgd.kind` | string | with `dgd` | Must be `DynamoGraphDeployment`. |
| `dgd.metadata` | object | no | Native DGD metadata overrides, subject to upstream validation. |
| `dgd.spec` | object | with `dgd` | Partial DGD fields in the declared API version's shape. |

Only `profilingJob` and `dgd` are accepted as children of `intent.overrides`.
Arrays, scalars, and null are not substitutes for these objects. A deadline-only
`profilingJob` is valid input. When rendering, Runway supplies the empty
`template.spec.containers: []` structure wherever those fields are absent. This
satisfies released DGDR schemas and survives Dynamo's typed API round-trip without
replacing generated profiling-job settings. Unknown native
fields and incompatible versions fail validation. Runway does not translate the
override from one DGD shape to another.

- Alpha uses `dgd.spec.services.<serviceName>.extraPodSpec.mainContainer`.
  Worker `args` append to the generated arguments.
- For Dynamo 1.5, use beta's `dgd.spec.components[]` entries identified by `name`,
  with `podTemplate.spec.containers[]` entries also identified by `name`.
  Container `args` replaces the generated list unless the same container includes
  `$patch: {args: append}`. Append requires a non-empty argument list and an
  existing target container with generated arguments. Runway preserves `$patch`
  for the upstream merge.

The typed path rejects `resources` and `replicas` recursively, including inside
arrays. GPU sizing remains controlled by `intent.hardware.totalGpus`. Privileged
fields, including `securityContext`, service-account selection, and host access,
remain forbidden. Nested overrides do not enable manual `spec.resources`,
`spec.scaling`, or ordinary engine image/argument fields.

Do not confuse this path with legacy `spec.provider.overrides.spec`. That sibling
`spec` block is still incompatible with typed `intent`; it cannot be added beside
`intent` to customize the request.

Overrides participate in profiling-input immutability. After profiling starts,
changes require an explicit new attempt through Reconfigure or a new
`airunway.ai/dynamo-attempt` annotation submitted together with the changed inputs.
A reconfiguration request's `intent` replaces the whole intent, not a deep merge.
Include every desired setting; omitting `overrides` removes existing overrides.
Retrying without replacement inputs retains them.

See the [complete Qwen3 example and both override shapes](providers.md#advanced-automatic-configuration)
and the sample at
`controller/config/samples/airunway_v1alpha1_modeldeployment_dynamo_intent.yaml`.

### status.provider workload references

Providers can report `requestRef`, `workloadRef`, and `inferencePoolRef`. Each
reference contains `apiVersion`, `kind`, `name`, `namespace`, and the observed
`uid`. Existing `resourceName` and `resourceKind` fields remain for compatibility.

For automatic Dynamo deployments, `requestRef` identifies the DGDR and
`workloadRef` identifies the generated DGD. `intent` contains `phase`,
`profilingPhase`, `inputHash`, and the accepted `attempt` token. These fields are
controller-owned status, not configuration users should populate.

See [Dynamo deployment modes](providers.md#dynamo-deployment-modes) for typed intent
inputs and explicit reconfiguration semantics.

## InferenceProviderConfig

Cluster-scoped resource for provider registration. Each provider controller self-registers its `InferenceProviderConfig` at startup, declaring capabilities and selection rules in `spec`, and display, installation, health, and documentation metadata in `metadata.annotations`:

```yaml

### Provider Metadata and Capabilities Annotations

Providers should declare scheduling capabilities in `spec.capabilities`. They may also mirror display and discovery metadata in annotations for dashboard clients and older integrations.

| Annotation | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `airunway.ai/display-name` | string | Human-friendly provider name shown in the UI. |
| `airunway.ai/description` | string | Short provider description shown in runtime/provider lists. |
| `airunway.ai/default-namespace` | string | Default namespace suggested by the UI for provider workloads or installation. |
| `airunway.ai/documentation-url` | string | Canonical URL to provider documentation. |
| `airunway.ai/documentation` | string | Backward-compatible documentation URL fallback. |
| `airunway.ai/capabilities` | JSON string | Optional compatibility mirror of provider capabilities. New controllers should keep `spec.capabilities` authoritative. |
| `airunway.ai/health` | JSON string | Optional CRD/operator/status probes used by the dashboard to check live provider health. |

### Installation Metadata

| Annotation | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `airunway.ai/installation` | JSON string | Installation metadata (description, defaultNamespace, helmRepos, helmCharts, steps). The backend parses this JSON to show installation commands and steps in the UI. |

## AgentProviderConfig

Cluster-scoped resource for agent framework registration. Capabilities stay in `spec`, while marketplace metadata and install guidance are carried in annotations.

```yaml
apiVersion: airunway.ai/v1alpha1
kind: AgentProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: kagent
  annotations:
    airunway.ai/agent-catalog: |
      [
        {
          "name": "kagent-k8s-sre",
          "title": "Kubernetes SRE (Kagent)",
          "description": "Diagnose deployments, pods, and networking.",
          "tags": ["devops", "observability"]
        }
      ]
    airunway.ai/install-instructions: "Install the Kagent operator before deploying agents with this framework."
spec:
  capabilities:
    backend: crd
    requiresOperator: true
    operatorAPIGroup: kagent.dev/v1alpha2
    modelBindingModes: [deploymentRef, gatewayEndpoint, externalAPI]
    protocols: [mcp, a2a, openaiTools]
status:
  ready: true
  version: "agent-kagent-provider:v0.1.0"
```

### AgentProviderConfig annotations

| Annotation | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `airunway.ai/agent-catalog` | JSON string | Catalog entries shown in the agent marketplace UI. Value must be a JSON array of items with unique `name` and non-empty `title`. |
| `airunway.ai/install-instructions` | string | Plain-text install guidance. Appended to the provider config's `Ready` message for `OperatorNotInstalled` and `OperatorAPIGroupMissing`, and onto each dependent AgentDeployment's `FrameworkReady` message for any not-ready reason. |

## AgentDeployment model binding behavior

For `spec.model.gatewayEndpoint`, the core controller combines a published IP
or hostname from `Gateway.status.addresses` with an HTTP(S) listener's protocol
and port. Set `gatewayRef.listenerName` when the Gateway has more than one
HTTPRoute-capable HTTP(S) listener. It may be omitted when exactly one compatible
listener exists. The selected listener must report current `Accepted`,
`ResolvedRefs`, and `Programmed` conditions as true. The resolved URL always
includes the listener port and the OpenAI-compatible `/v1` path.

When the selected listener declares a concrete hostname, that hostname becomes
the URL authority so HTTP Host matching and HTTPS SNI/certificate validation use
the listener identity. A wildcard hostname cannot identify one concrete model
endpoint and is rejected. A listener without a hostname uses the published
Gateway address.

For `spec.model.externalAPI`, `baseURL` must be an absolute `http` or `https`
URL with a host, no embedded user information, and a port from 1 through 65535
when a port is present. Invalid values are rejected during admission on both
create and update, and reconciliation repeats the check for objects created
while the webhook was unavailable.

For `spec.model.deploymentRef`, the core controller resolves the model binding in this order:

1. If `ModelDeployment.status.gateway` records a Gateway identity, resolve that Gateway and its sole compatible ready listener, then combine the listener authority, protocol, and port into an OpenAI-compatible `/v1` base URL. This also recovers when the Gateway publishes its first address after the ModelDeployment status was written. Gateway-backed bindings are periodically rechecked because Gateway status is not watched directly. If the Gateway has multiple compatible ready listeners, `deploymentRef` preserves the endpoint already published in `ModelDeployment.status.gateway.endpoint` because this binding mode has no listener selector. It does not preserve that endpoint when none of those listeners are ready.
2. Else fall back to the model Service endpoint from `ModelDeployment.status.endpoint`.

`status.gateway.gatewayName` and `gatewayNamespace` identify which Gateway was selected, but are **not** used to construct an address. A Gateway resource name is not a Service DNS name. Gateway API does not require an implementation to name its data-plane Service after the Gateway, and implementations differ. Deriving `http://<gatewayName>.<gatewayNamespace>.svc.cluster.local` from them would produce an address that does not resolve on some clusters.

The resolved `status.modelBinding.modelName` prefers `status.gateway.modelName`, then `spec.model.servedName`, then `spec.model.id`.

For keyless in-cluster `deploymentRef` bindings, core leaves `status.modelBinding.credentialsRef` empty. Container backends inject `OPENAI_API_KEY=not-required` directly, while CRD backends provision an Airunway-managed per-agent no-auth Secret and reference it in their rendered CRs.

`spec.provider.overrides` is an escape hatch for validated security-context overrides. Supported sections are `workload` and `container`, each allowing only `podSecurityContext` and `securityContext` keys with allow-listed security fields.
